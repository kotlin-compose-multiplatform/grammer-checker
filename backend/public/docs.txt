1. UI Construction
HTML Structure

Page Header:
The <head> section defines the page's metadata, imports the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts, and includes inline CSS for styling.
The <title> specifies the page title as "Grammar Checker."
Body Layout:
Contains a div with the container class that houses two main sections:
Grammar Checker Section (grammer-section):
Includes a heading (h1) labeled "Gramatika Barlaýjy."
Features a form where users input a sentence, triggering grammar checks via two buttons:
Barla (Simple Check)
AI bilen Barla (AI-based Check).
Displays feedback dynamically via an unordered list (ul#feedbackList).
Dictionary Section (dictionary-section):
Displays a heading (h2) for "Söz Manylary" (Word Meanings).
Uses an unordered list (ul#dictionaryResults) to dynamically populate dictionary meanings for words in the input sentence.
Footer:
Includes a fixed footer at the bottom with attribution text, "Pena Muhammetberdiýew tarapyndan döredilen."
2. Styling
Base Styles:

Applies global reset styles (e.g., padding: 0; margin: 0;) for consistency.
Sets a font family of "Poppins" and a gradient background animation for a visually appealing design.
Container and Section Layout:

Container (.container):
Defines a responsive flexbox layout for proper alignment of sections.
Ensures gaps between sections and wraps content for smaller screens.
Grammar Checker and Dictionary Sections:
Use rounded borders (border-radius: 10px) and subtle shadows (box-shadow) for a card-like appearance.
Apply a white background with slight transparency (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)) for contrast.
Interactive Elements:

Form Inputs:
Styled with padding, rounded borders, and a clear font for readability.
Buttons:
Include hover effects (opacity: 0.9) and distinctive styles for the AI-specific button (.ai_button).
Responsive Design:

Adapts the layout for smaller screens with media queries, stacking sections vertically.
3. Functionality
Grammar Checker Logic (checkSentence):

Input Handling:
Retrieves user input from the sentence text field.
API Interaction:
Sends a POST request to a grammar-checking endpoint (/proxy/spellcheck).
Parses the JSON response to extract and display spelling mistakes along with suggestions.
Error Suggestions:
Dynamically populates feedbackList with buttons for suggested corrections.
Suggestion buttons replace the incorrect word with the selected alternative in the input field.
Word Replacement (replaceWord):

Uses JavaScript's RegExp to replace incorrect words globally in the sentence.
Automatically rechecks the updated sentence.
Dictionary Data Retrieval (getDictionaryData):

Splits the input sentence into individual words.
Sends a POST request to the /get-word endpoint, passing the words as a JSON array.
Dynamically updates the dictionaryResults list with meanings fetched from the response.
Error Handling:

Provides feedback (<li>Gaýtadan synanşyň.</li>) in case of API failures or connectivity issues.
4. Development Process
Design Philosophy:
Emphasizes usability and visual clarity.
Uses modern CSS techniques like animations and responsive design for aesthetic appeal.
Functionality Implementation:
JavaScript functions are modular, focusing on specific tasks (e.g., checkSentence, replaceWord).
Error handling ensures graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable.
User Interaction:
Provides real-time feedback and interaction, improving user engagement (e.g., dynamic suggestion buttons).
Extensibility:
Allows for further enhancements, such as integrating additional features (e.g., multilingual support or advanced AI checks).
